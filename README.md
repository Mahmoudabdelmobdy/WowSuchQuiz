# wow_such_quiz

A very basic quiz app built using flutter for android.

## Building

You will require flutter as well as the Android SDK(provided by default with Android Studio).

1. Clone the repo and open the repo folder with your favorite editor(I would personally suggest vs-code) or open the project with Android Studio.
1. Download any required extensions as prompted by your IDE.
1. Connect your android device with debugger options turned on or use an android emulator(can be setup using android studio)
1. Run main.dart and you are ready to go
